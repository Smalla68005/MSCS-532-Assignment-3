# MSCS-532-Assignment-3
## Overview
This project is designed to analyze and compare the efficiency and scalability of two key algorithms: Randomized Quicksort and Hashing with Chaining

### Randomized Quicksort 
The running time of Randomized Quicksort is empirically compared with Deterministic Quicksort (which uses the first element as the pivot) on various input sizes and distributions:
1. Randomly generated arrays
2. Already sorted arrays
3. Reverse-sorted arrays
4. Arrays with repeated elements

### Hashing with Chaining
A Hash Table using chaining for collision resolution is implemented. A suitable hash function from a universal hash function family is used to minimize collisions. The implementation efficiently supports the following operations:
1. Insert: Add a key-value pair to the hash table.
2. Search: Retrieve a value associated with a given key.
3. Delete: Remove a key-value pair from the hash table.

## Instructions on Running the program
